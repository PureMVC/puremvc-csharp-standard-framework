	 * The interface definition for a PureMVC Notification.
	 *
	 * <P>
	 * PureMVC does not rely upon underlying event models such 
	 * as the one provided with Flash, and ActionScript 3 does 
	 * not have an inherent event model.</P>
	 * 
	 * <P>
	 * The Observer Pattern as implemented within PureMVC exists 
	 * to support event-driven communication between the 
	 * application and the actors of the MVC triad.</P>
	 * 
	 * <P>
	 * Notifications are not meant to be a replacement for Events
	 * in Flex/Flash/Apollo. Generally, <code>IMediator</code> implementors
	 * place event listeners on their view components, which they
	 * then handle in the usual way. This may lead to the broadcast of <code>Notification</code>s to 
	 * trigger <code>ICommand</code>s or to communicate with other <code>IMediators</code>. <code>IProxy</code> and <code>ICommand</code>
	 * instances communicate with each other and <code>IMediator</code>s 
	 * by broadcasting <code>INotification</code>s.</P>
	 * 
	 * <P>
	 * A key difference between Flash <code>Event</code>s and PureMVC 
	 * <code>Notification</code>s is that <code>Event</code>s follow the 
	 * 'Chain of Responsibility' pattern, 'bubbling' up the display hierarchy 
	 * until some parent component handles the <code>Event</code>, while
	 * PureMVC <code>Notification</code>s follow a 'Publish/Subscribe'
	 * pattern. PureMVC classes need not be related to each other in a 
	 * parent/child relationship in order to communicate with one another
	 * using <code>Notification</code>s.
	 *
